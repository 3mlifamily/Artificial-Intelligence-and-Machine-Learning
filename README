This project will contain my algorithm implementations for the Stanford's online
courses:
  * Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: http://www.ai-class.com
  * Introduction to Machine Learning: http://www.ml-class.com

In observance of the Stanford's honor code, I will submit my code to this
repository only after the correspondent homework assignments are officially
closed.
